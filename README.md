Paste.ee Client (PasteEEClient)
==========
A simple Paste.ee uploader for BlackBerry 10

Although, since it's Cascades, the PasteClient source files in the /src directory also count as a Paste.ee uploader for Qt4.

## Requirements
* BlackBerry OS 10.2.0+

## What it Does
* Upload some text to paste.ee (as plaintext) and get the uploaded URL in return

## How to Contribute
If it's related to Cascades/Qt, send it upstream to me.

If it's related to the service itself, [contact Paste.ee](mailto:contact@paste.ee).

If you liked it, why not [donate to keep Paste.ee running](http://probablyaserver.com/donate)?
